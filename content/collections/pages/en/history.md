                text: 'The idea of the project began with a meeting between Angelika and Dietrich Harthan and a leading employee in the “Kasbah Tamadot“ from Sir Richard Branson in Asni, Morocco. During their many conversations with Omar Bouhmid, who painted a vivid picture of the living conditions of the people in this region and the country, the Harthans were able to understand the challenges and the opportunities of the region, as well as to draw up a plan to help people there. This led in turn to another important meeting with the principal of the local school.'

Those who are familiar with music pedagogy know how important music is to the development of children and youths. Thus the initiative to start offering music lessons in the school was borne. With the help of Omar Bouhmid, the Asni Music School was founded.'

It was clear from the beginning that regardless of the ideas of gender separation, boy and girls will take part in the music lessons side-by-side.'
