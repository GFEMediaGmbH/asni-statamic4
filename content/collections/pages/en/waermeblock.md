In Iran, we were able to find a meaningful use for this “waste product”. After production, the “rose slurry” is put into wooden frames and dried in the sun – similar to the traditional method in which clay bricks are made. This process produces what appears to be old rose bricks from the petals. These bricks can be used as fragrant burning logs. More than 1000 pieces of these bricks have been brought to Germany to be used.'

Instead of the worldwide exploitation of human and natural resources in poorer countries, we have embodied in this artwork the idea of the common good. In addition, through this work, a fair share of the global value is equitably distributed. A sustainable globalization instead of a profit-oriented one is necessary. The rose brick illustrates global responsibility for the social and ecological future of society. '
