Fortunately, the Asni Music School is so successful that we have more than 100 pupils who come each week for lessons.

However, this also means that the school urgently needs a bigger space for our students. The original idea of building on the existing primary school property couldnâ€™t be implemented for different reasons. A new piece of land had to be found, which turned out to be a difficult undertaking.

After a long search, in the summer of 2019, a Moroccan man who immigrated to Canada offered to sell us a beautiful piece of land at the edge of the village. This 400 square meter land, after long negotiations, has been bought by the Moroccan Association AMARG.

After a long delay, we were well on the way to actually implementing our school building in the summer of 2023, until the night of September 8, 2023, when a terrible earthquake dramatically shook Morocco and in particular our project region and the community of Asni at the foot of the Atlas Mountains! An earthquake that affected at least 300,000 people, including 100,000 children alone, and killed more than 2,900 people! There was misery and suffering here in Asni too, where hardly a single house remained completely intact and habitable. Thank God there were no victims among the staff of our music school and the local AMARG association, all pupils are still alive, even though relatives of our children in Asni have lost their lives.


Almost all the buildings in Asni have collapsed, with a few exceptions, including our new school building, which was apparently - miraculously - largely spared serious earthquake damage! It is not yet completely clear what additional costs we will have to face and what other consequences of the earthquake we will have to cushion. Nevertheless, we remain confident and hope to be able to complete the new school building by next summer. We are about to resume our lessons in temporary wooden containers, which also housed the village school after the earthquake.
