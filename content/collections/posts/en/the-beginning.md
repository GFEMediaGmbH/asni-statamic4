Fortunately, the Asni Music School is so successful that we have more than 100 pupils who come each week for lessons.

However, this also means that the school urgently needs a bigger space for our students. The original idea of building on the existing primary school property couldnâ€™t be implemented for different reasons. A new piece of land had to be found, which turned out to be a difficult undertaking.

After a long search, in the summer of 2019, a Moroccan man who immigrated to Canada offered to sell us a beautiful piece of land at the edge of the village. This 400 square meter land, after long negotiations, has been bought by the Moroccan Association AMARG.
