After a long delay, we were well on the way to actually implementing our school building in the summer of 2023, until the night of September 8, 2023, when a terrible earthquake dramatically shook Morocco and in particular our project region and the community of Asni at the foot of the Atlas Mountains! An earthquake that affected at least 300,000 people, including 100,000 children alone, and killed more than 2,900 people! There was misery and suffering here in Asni too, where hardly a single house remained completely intact and habitable. Thank God there were no victims among the staff of our music school and the local AMARG association, all pupils are still alive, even though relatives of our children in Asni have lost their lives.


Almost all the buildings in Asni have collapsed, with a few exceptions, including our new school building, which was apparently - miraculously - largely spared serious earthquake damage! It is not yet completely clear what additional costs we will have to face and what other consequences of the earthquake we will have to cushion. Nevertheless, we remain confident and hope to be able to complete the new school building by next summer. We are about to resume our lessons in temporary wooden containers, which also housed the village school after the earthquake.
