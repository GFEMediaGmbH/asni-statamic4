The architectural plan for the building is now finished. In order to economize, we decided not to build two floors. The structure will be one storey, with an additional floor reserved for the second phase of construction.

Several practice rooms as well as an auditorium for concerts and practice sessions in a large group are essential for the school.

As it is the case in Germany, the structure also needs to be a certain distance from the neighbouring property. We will of course need to comply with other building and security requirements as well.
